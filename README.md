## **‚ú® Key Features**

* **Dual Encryption Algorithms**:  
  * **AES-GCM**: Symmetric encryption using a password. Fast, efficient, and ideal for large files.  
  * **RSA-OAEP**: Asymmetric encryption using a public/private key pair. Perfect for secure communication.  
* **Complete Client-Side Security**: All cryptographic operations are performed in your browser using the **Web Crypto API**. Your passwords, keys, and data are never sent to any server.  
* **Text & File Support**: Encrypt and decrypt both plain text messages and any type of file (images, documents, etc.).  
* **Full Key Management**:  
  * Generate secure 2048-bit RSA key pairs.  
  * Export and import keys in the standard JWK (JSON Web Key) format.  
* **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  * Clean, modern, and fully responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.  
  * **Drag-and-drop** support for file uploads.  
  * Real-time **password strength meter** to encourage secure passwords.  
  * Convenient copy, paste, download, and clear buttons.  
  * Helpful tooltips to explain algorithms and provide security warnings.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**

* **HTML5**: For the core structure of the application.  
* **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first, responsive, and modern design.  
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all application logic and interactivity.  
* **Web Crypto API**: The browser's native API for performing secure cryptographic operations.  
* **Font Awesome**: For clean and recognizable icons.

## **üöÄ How to Use**

### **Encrypting with AES (Password)**

1. Ensure **Operation** is set to Encrypt.  
2. Select the **Algorithm** AES-GCM (Password).  
3. Enter a strong password in the **Password / Secret Key** field.  
4. Type your text in the **Input** box or upload a file.  
5. Click **Process**.  
6. The encrypted result will appear in the **Output** box. You can copy or download it.

### **Decrypting with AES (Password)**

1. Set **Operation** to Decrypt.  
2. Select the **Algorithm** AES-GCM (Password).  
3. Enter the **exact same password** used for encryption.  
4. Paste the encrypted text into the **Input** box or upload the encrypted file.  
5. Click **Process**.  
6. The original data will be restored in the **Output** box.

### **Encrypting with RSA (Key Pair)**

1. Ensure **Operation** is set to Encrypt.  
2. Select the **Algorithm** RSA-OAEP (Key Pair).  
3. If you don't have keys, click **Generate New RSA Keys**.  
4. Provide the **Public Key** of the recipient. You can paste it in or import it from a file.  
5. Enter your text or upload a small file in the **Input** box.  
6. Click **Process**.

### **Decrypting with RSA (Key Pair)**

1. Set **Operation** to Decrypt.  
2. Select the **Algorithm** RSA-OAEP (Key Pair).  
3. Provide your **Private Key** (keep this secret\!).  
4. Paste the encrypted text into the **Input** box or upload the encrypted file.  
5. Click **Process**.
